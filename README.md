## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **C++ Compiler** (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- **Raylib** library ([Installation Guide](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib#build-and-installation))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-visualizer.git
cd sorting-visualizer
```

2. **Install Raylib** (if not already installed)

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# Using package manager
sudo apt install libraylib-dev  # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install raylib             # macOS

# Or build from source
git clone https://github.com/raysan5/raylib.git
cd raylib/src
make PLATFORM=PLATFORM_DESKTOP
sudo make install
```

**Windows:**
- Download from [Raylib Releases](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases)
- Follow the [Windows Installation Guide](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-Windows)

3. **Compile the project**
```bash
# Linux/macOS
g++ main.cpp -o sorting_visualizer -lraylib -lGL -lm -lpthread -ldl -lrt -lX11

# Windows (MinGW)
g++ main.cpp -o sorting_visualizer.exe -lraylib -lopengl32 -lgdi32 -lwinmm

# Or use the provided Makefile (if available)
make
```

4. **Run the visualizer**
```bash
./sorting_visualizer          # Linux/macOS
sorting_visualizer.exe        # Windows
```

## üéÆ Controls

| Key | Algorithm |
|-----|-----------|
| `1` | Bubble Sort |
| `2` | Selection Sort |
| `3` | Insertion Sort |
| `4` | Quick Sort |
| `5` | Merge Sort |
| `6` | Heap Sort |
| `7` | Shell Sort |
| `8` | Counting Sort |

Press any number key to switch algorithms. The array will automatically regenerate with random values.

## üìä Understanding the Visualization

### Color Meanings:
- **Red bars**: Currently being compared or processed
- **Blue bars**: Special elements (pivot in Quick Sort, minimum in Selection Sort, etc.)
- **Green bars**: Elements in their final sorted position (Heap Sort)
- **Light gray bars**: Unsorted elements

### How It Works:
Each sorting function performs one small step per frame, allowing you to see:
- Which elements are being compared
- When swaps occur
- How the algorithm progresses through the array
- The final sorted result

## üîß Configuration

You can customize the visualization by modifying these constants in `main.cpp`:

```cpp
#define NUM_BARS 50           // Number of bars to sort (10-100 recommended)
#define WINDOWS_WIDTH 800     // Window width in pixels
#define WINDOWS_HEIGHT 450    // Window height in pixels
```

To adjust the speed, modify the FPS:
```cpp
SetTargetFPS(60);  // Increase for faster, decrease for slower
```

## üìö Algorithm Details

### Bubble Sort
The simplest sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they're in the wrong order.

### Selection Sort
Finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion and places it at the beginning. Blue highlights the current minimum.

### Insertion Sort
Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, inserting each element into its correct position.

### Quick Sort
Efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm using a pivot (shown in blue) to partition the array.

### Merge Sort
Divides the array into halves recursively, then merges them back in sorted order. Red and blue show the two subarrays being merged.

### Heap Sort
Converts the array into a max heap structure, then repeatedly extracts the maximum. Green shows sorted elements.

### Shell Sort
An optimization of insertion sort that allows exchanges of far-apart elements, using diminishing gap sequences.

### Counting Sort
Non-comparison sort that counts occurrences of each value. Works efficiently for integer arrays with limited range.

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

- Counting Sort requires bars with heights from 0 to `WINDOWS_HEIGHT`
- Very large arrays (>200 bars) may slow down visualization
- Static variables are used for step-by-step progression

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here are some ideas:
- Add more sorting algorithms (Radix Sort, Bucket Sort, etc.)
- Implement pause/resume functionality
- Add speed control slider
- Display comparison and swap counters
- Add sound effects for operations

### How to Contribute:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/NewAlgorithm`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add Radix Sort'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/NewAlgorithm`)
5. Open a Pull Request
